The Podcaster is a user configurable recording tool which records two versions of a radio show, podcast, or other audio simultaneously: one high-quality version for archiving, and another low-quality version for re-distribution via podcasts and other miscellaneous reasons.  Eventually, we hope to allow the Podcaster to support any number of recorders at a variety of channel modes and bitrates, as well as multiple sound cards, to fit as many needs as possible.

At this point in time, to learn more about the Podcaster, we recommend reading the documentation.  We are currently working on drawing diagrams and making pictures that better explain how the Podcaster works.

The Podcaster project was started by and is currently maintained by KLIK Radio, a 501(c)(3) non-profit Internet radio station run by high school students in Fort Collins, Colorado. The Podcaster is designed to be one program that KLIK volunteers can work with to start learning how to program.  Our goal is to make simple code that is readable to people of all skill levels (this means extensive commenting and explanations throughout the code itself), very modular (so beginners can start at the top and work their way down, while those who have prior experience can jump in wherever they feel comfortable), and most importantly - set an example for code that is well-documented and well-designed.

The "beginner" interface - for DJ's who are just started and needing minimal distractions from using equipment and automation software

The "intermediate" interface - for DJ's who aren't quite ready for the features of the advanced interface, but need more control over podcast recording than what the basic interface can provide.
